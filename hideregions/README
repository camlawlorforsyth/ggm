hideregions: Tool to fill in point sources with random values from
the surrounding pixels. It's only tested for Chandra images.

Copyright Jeremy Sanders, released under the GPLv2+.

hideregions is a C++ code which links against the CIAO region
libraries. It uses a C++ wrapper library to CIAO (dmxx).

Requirements for building:
 - Chandra CIAO environment running
 - C++ compiler (only gcc g++ tested)
 - Boost library

To build inspect the Makefile (and dm/Makefile) and run

# make all

If all went well, you'll have a hideregions executable.

To use, run

# hideregions in.fits points.reg out.fits

Note that points.reg must be a CIAO region file in PHYSICAL
COORDINATES. Only circle and ellipse regions are supported!

WCS data are lost in the output file!
