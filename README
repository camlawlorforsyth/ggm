This repository contains useful utilities for Gaussian gradient
filtering of X-ray images.

The programs are described in

gaussian_gradient_magnitude.py
------------------------------

The main program is gaussian_gradient_magnitude.py. This utility
filters and input fits image with a particular scale, sigma.

Requirements:
 - Python 2.7, pyfits, numpy, scipy

To run, type

./gaussian_gradient_magnitude.py in.fits out.fits sigma

Where sigma is a floating point value >0

hideregions2
------------

This is a tool to cosmetically hide point sources in X-ray images. It
fills point sources with random values from the surrounding pixel
region. See hideregions2/README for details.

ggm_combine
-----------

This is an interactive tool to combine fits images filtered on
different scales. See ggm_combine/README for details.
